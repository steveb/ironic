    When a conductor service is stopped it will now continue to respond to RPC
    requests until ``[DEFAULT]hash_ring_reset_interval`` has elapsed, allowing
    a hash ring reset to complete on the cluster after conductor is
    unregistered. This will improve the reliability of the cluster when scaling
    down or rolling out updates.
